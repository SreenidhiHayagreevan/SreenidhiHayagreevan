## 🌟 Featured Projects
### 🚧 [GuardRail for LLM](https://github.com/SreenidhiHayagreevan/GuardRail_For_LLM)
- Designed and implemented a multi-layer guardrail framework for LLM that detects and flags LLM hallucinations.
- Built fully automated data pipeline to ingest, preprocess ~700K+ samples across 7 datasets (focused on 7 domains).
- Achieved strong performance on reliability metrics - ROC-AUC ≥ 0.95 for toxicity, hallucination ,and gaps on gender bias.
​- Built an interactive Streamlit UI to demo the guardrail pipeline, visualizing safety checks, hallucination flags.

### 🗣️ [Named Entity Recognition for Vehicle Attribute Extraction](https://github.com/SreenidhiHayagreevan/Natural-Language-Processing)
- Developed a NER system on the FindVehicle dataset (~42K descriptions, 1.36M tokens, 21 entity classes) to extract vehicle color, brand, model, type, location,  and velocity from natural language descriptions for traffic monitoring​
- Implemented a full preprocessing pipeline converting CoNLL-style annotations to tabular format, applying BIOE tagging, and validating token label alignment for fine-grained vehicle attributes.
- Designed and trained multiple sequence models (RNN, LSTM, BiLSTM) and transformer-based models (eg: BERT, etc.).
- Fine-tuned RoBERTa-base with AdamW and cross-entropy loss to achieve an F1 score of ~0.96 and accuracy ~0.98, outperforming all other baselines and handling overlapping entities and multi-word vehicle attributes robustly.

### 🔐 [Job Scam Detection in Gmail](https://github.com/SreenidhiHayagreevan/Job-Offer-Scam-Detection)  
Developed a machine learning system to detect fraudulent job-related emails using structured and unstructured data.  
- Engineered 15+ custom features (e.g., scam keywords, sender metadata).  
- Compared models (Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest); final model reached **96.7% accuracy** and **73.4% F1-score**.  
- Used SHAP for explainability and SMOTE for class imbalance.  
- Designed a complete pipeline from data collection to deployment.

### 🎬 [Content and Behavior-Aware Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/SreenidhiHayagreevan/Movie-Recomendation)  
Built a real-time hybrid movie recommendation engine using Node.js, Python, and React.  
- Created NLP-based metadata extractor using subtitles to infer genres.  
- Tracked user behavior (watch time, replays, skips) for personalized recommendations.  
- Achieved over **80% accuracy** with sub-100ms latency using modular distributed design.  
- Deployed full-stack system with cloud-hosted MongoDB Atlas and AWS Amplify.

### 🏥 [Big Data-Driven Health Risk Assessment](https://github.com/SreenidhiHayagreevan/bigdata-health-management-system)  
Analyzed 141M+ health records from wearable devices using PySpark and Hadoop.  
- Engineered health risk features, handled missing data, and clustered users into risk tiers.  
- Built a **linear regression model** with **0.91 R² accuracy** for real-time scoring.  
- Developed interactive Streamlit dashboards for risk visualization.

### 📈 [Stock Market Analytics and Price Forecasting](https://github.com/SreenidhiHayagreevan/data226-lab2)  
Built an automated stock price forecasting pipeline with Alpha Vantage API, Airflow, and Snowflake.  
- Predicted stock prices for Netflix and Intuitive Surgical with **96–98% accuracy**.  
- Engineered technical indicators using dbt and visualized results in Preset dashboards.

### 🛒 [Retail Demand Forecasting System](https://github.com/SreenidhiHayagreevan/Retail-Demand-Forecasting)  
Forecasted retail inventory demand using SARIMA, XGBoost, and LSTM.  
- Integrated weather and economic data; automated ETL with Airflow.  
- Achieved **MAPE < 15%**, with a **20% reduction in inventory costs** and **50% fewer stockouts**.  
- Visualized performance with Superset dashboards connected to Snowflake.
